2:21pm image 1: PCLK (yellow), D2 (Green), HSYNC (blue)
-second image with series resistor

- not getting data in DR register of DCMI
- may be caused by very noisy data lines
- need to try adding capacitor to 3V line and series resistors to all lines (330ohms?)
	- look up transmission reflections and why this is happening
